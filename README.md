At the end of every day we are going to give you guys time for independent study. We know that there are topics in class that will especially appeal to you individually that we may not get to spend a lot of time on. As you get more advanced, there will be things you really want to learn. We want to give you all the time to develop those interests and skills.

We want to be able to treat you all like adults, and a lot of our ability to do that means that we expect you all to act like adults. This isn't time to play on Facebook or catch up on ESPN or Tumblr or play online games. This is time to really work on things that interest you. You will only get as much out of this time that you put into it.

There will always be labs on Learn.co that you can work on, but here are a couple of other projects that you might want to consider. 

## Portfolio

+ Set up an online portfolio to show off your work. Here are some examples:
  * [Marisa Poster](http://marisaposter.com/)
  * [Catherine Codes](http://catherinecodes.com/)
  * [Mitch Boyer](http://mitchboyer.com/)
  * [Randall Reed](http://randallreedjr.com/portfolio/)

## Blogging

Start blogging about your experience. Writing about what you are learning here is a great way to solidify the concepts, share your experience and build your online presence. Flatiron student's blog posts get shared all the time through newsletters and other media sites. A couple examples: 

  * [Christine Ehcho](http://christinehcho.tumblr.com/)
  * [Fr4ns C0mput3r](http://fr4nsc0mput3r.tumblr.com/)

Whatever you choose, the important thing is that you're learning, working, and having fun!
